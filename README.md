# Phase Unwrapping for Polarization Measurements

This repository provides MATLAB code for phase unwrapping of wrapped phase signals,
developed for polarization-related measurements and multispectral Mueller matrix analysis.

The code is designed for experimental data processing, where phase wrapping occurs
due to limited dynamic range or periodic phase responses, and supports multi-channel
(e.g., RGB) inputs.

## Features
- Phase unwrapping of wrapped phase signals
- Support for multi-channel (RGB) data
- Robust to experimental noise
- Suitable for polarization and Mueller matrix measurements

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2024b or later (recommended)
