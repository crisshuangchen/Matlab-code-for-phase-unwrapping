# Phase Unwrapping for Polarization Measurements

This repository provides MATLAB code for phase unwrapping at three distinct wavelengths,
developed for multispectral Mueller matrix analysis.

The code is designed to retrieve the true retardance from real Mueller matrix inputs and supports multi-channel (RGB) data.

## Features
- Phase unwrapping
- Multi-channel (RGB) Mueller matrix

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2024b or later (recommended)
